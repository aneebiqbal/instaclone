Then Run The app

npm start Runs your app in development mode. Open it in the Expo app on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

npm run ios Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

npm run android Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup).
